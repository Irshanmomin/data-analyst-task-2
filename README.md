My final dashboard titled “SUPERSTAR 2017 DATA VISUALISATION” presents a clean and insightful analysis of sales performance across categories, months and regions using Power BI.

It includes:
1) Two KPI Cards (Sum of Quantity and Sum of Profit)
2) Two Slicers (Customer Name, State)
4) Four Core Visuals:

- Pie Chart → Profit by Category
- Tree Map → Sum of Sales and Profit by Sub-Category
- Clustered Column Chart → Sum of Sales by Region
- Line Chart → Sum of Sales by Month


Layout Description:

| KPI Cards: Quantity (256) | Profit (14.93K)
| Filters: Customer Name | State
| Pie Chart: Profit by Category
| Tree Map: Sales & Profit by Sub-Category
| Clustered Column Chart: Sales by Region
| Line Chart: Sales by Month

The dashboard follows a simple left-to-right and top-to-bottom reading flow, starting from key metrics (KPI cards), then filtering options and finally detailed visual insights.


Data Storytelling (Narrative Explanation)

- The dashboard offers a complete overview of Superstore’s 2017 sales and profit distribution.
- The KPI cards at the top summarize total product quantity sold (256 units) and total profit (₹14.93K), immediately showing the business scale.
- Using the slicers (Customer Name and State), users can dynamically filter the data to focus on specific customers or regions.
- The Pie Chart shows an almost even distribution of profit among the three main categories- Technology (34.07%), Office Supplies (33.28%) and Furniture (32.65%) indicating balanced performance across product lines.
- The Tree Map highlights sub-category performance where Phones, Tables and Chairs contribute majorly to overall sales and profits, while smaller items like Accessories and Binders have lesser impact.
- The Clustered Column Chart displays regional performance, showing fairly steady sales across all regions- South, Central, West and East with the South slightly leading.
- And the Line Chart depicts monthly sales trends, revealing gradual growth with noticeable increases toward the later months of the year, suggesting seasonal improvement in sales.
